    <li>Wear a mask</li>
        <p>Everyone 2 years and older should wear masks in public.
           Masks should be worn in addition to staying at least 6 feet apart, especially around people who don’t live with you.
           If someone in your household is infected, people in the household should take precautions including wearing masks to avoid spread to others.
           Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before putting on your mask.
           Wear your mask over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin.
           Fit the mask snugly against the sides of your face, slipping the loops over your ears or tying the strings behind your head.
           If you have to continually adjust your mask, it doesn’t fit properly, and you might need to find a different mask type or brand.
           Make sure you can breathe easily.</p>
   <li>Stay 6 feet away from others</li>
  	Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
	If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.
	Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t live in your household.
	Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.
   <li>Get Vaccinated</li>
	Authorized COVID-19 vaccines can help protect you from COVID-19.
	You should get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you.
	Once you are fully vaccinated, you may be able to start doing some things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.
   <li>Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated spaces</li>
	Being in crowds like in restaurants, bars, fitness centers, or movie theaters puts you at higher risk for COVID-19.
   <li>Wash your hands often</li>
	Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, coughing, or sneezing.
   <li>Cover coughs and sneezes</li>
	If you are wearing a mask: You can cough or sneeze into your mask. Put on a new, clean mask as soon as possible and wash your hands.
   <li>Monitor your health daily</li>
	Take your temperature if symptoms develop.
Don’t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen.
